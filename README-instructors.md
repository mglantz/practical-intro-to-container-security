# A Practical Introduction to Container Security

## Instructor's Guide

### Overview

This document provides an overview of the materials and context needed to run a hands-on, technical RHEL container security workshop. This workshop will allow attendees to explore the latest low level features and technology in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 while learning tangible lessons that can be applied to their job roles. 

The lab was initially created for the 2016 Red Hat Summit and has evolved and been presented each year since then.
