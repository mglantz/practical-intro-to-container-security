In this lab, you will use `podman` to sign container images and create trust policies to control access to registries. 

To begin the image signing procedure, a signature claim is generated by encrypting a container image manifest using a private
gpg key. The signature claims are stored in a file system or web
server where they can be decrypted later and used to pull signed
images.

The procedure is reversed when pulling signed images.

==== Configuring the signature claim store

On the bastion server, create a configuration for the `node1` registry. 

.Become root to do this.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *sudo -i*
```

.Create the configuration for node1.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
# *cat <<EOF > /etc/containers/registries.d/node1.{GUID}.internal.yaml

docker:
  node1.{GUID}.internal:5000:
    sigstore: file:///var/tmp/sigstore/node1.{GUID}.internal
    sigstore-staging: file:///var/tmp/sigstore/node1.{GUID}.internal
EOF*
```

.Exit from the root shell.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
# *exit*
```

Notice we are using the `/var/tmp/sigstore` directory to store signature claims. This allows the system administrator to configure the signature store for a given registry and allows rootless users to push and pull signed container images.

.Create a directory for the signature claims for the node1 registry.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *mkdir -p /usr/tmp/sigstore/node1.{GUID}.internal*
```

==== Generating key pairs

.Generate the gpg key pair. You'll be prompted to set a pass phrase. Set it to `redhat` so you don't forget. :)
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *gpg2 --quick-gen-key --yes %USERNAME%*
```

.Now export the public key. You'll need it later.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *mkdir /usr/tmp/keys*
$ *gpg2 --export %USERNAME% > /usr/tmp/keys/gpg-pubkey.gpg*
```

.Confirm you have a container image with the **correct REPOSITORY and TAG** as shown.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *podman tag %RHEL_CONTAINER% node1.{GUID}.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi*


$ *podman images*

REPOSITORY                                  TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
node1.{GUID}.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi          latest   a4a954bf99ed   2 weeks ago   831 MB
%RHEL_CONTAINER%         latest   a4a954bf99ed   2 weeks ago   831 MB
```

.Login to the registry, then sign and push the image. When `podman` signs the image it will prompt for the gpg key pass phrase you used to create the key pair. It then creates a signature claim.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *podman login --username=redhat --password=redhat node1.{GUID}.internal:5000*

Login Succeeded!

$ *podman push --sign-by %USERNAME% node1.{GUID}.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi*

```

==== Working with trust policies

In this exercise you will configure the image trust policy so that it allows only signed images to be pulled from a trusted registry on node1. 

.Start by examining the current trust policy (which accepts anything)then create a default policy that rejects all image pulls.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *podman image trust show*

default             insecureAcceptAnything                         
```

.Change the policy to reject by default.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *sudo podman image trust set -t reject default*
$ *podman image trust show*

          insecureAcceptAnything      
default   reject
```

==== Pulling signed images

.Now we are ready to try an image pull. To make certain you are authenticated to the registry, login again.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *podman login --username=redhat --password=redhat node1.{GUID}.internal:5000*

Login Succeeded!
```

.Now test that image pulls are rejected by default.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *podman pull node1.{GUID}.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi*

Trying to pull node1.{GUID}.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi...
  Running image docker://node1.{GUID}.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi:latest is rejected by p
olicy.
Error: error pulling image "node1.{GUID}.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi": unable to pull nod
e1.summit.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi: unable to pull image: Source image rejected: Runni
ng image docker://node1.{GUID}.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi:latest is rejected by policy.
```

.Set a trust policy for node1.{GUID}.internal using your exported public gpg key.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *sudo podman image trust set --type signedBy --pubkeysfile /usr/tmp/keys/gpg-pubkey.gpg node1.{GUID}.internal:5000*
```

.Now examine the image trust again. It should show that any image pulls from node1.{GUID}.internal must be signed. 
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *podman image trust show*

default                      reject                              
node1.summit.internal:5000   signedBy                 ec2-user   file:///var/tmp/s
igstore/node1.summit.internal
```

.Finally, try to pull the image from the trusted registry on node1.{GUID}.internal and it should succeed.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *podman pull node1.{GUID}.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi:latest*

Trying to pull node1.summit.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi...

==== Create a trust policy for Red Hat images. 

In this exercise, you will create a trust policy that allows only signed images to be pulled from Red Hat's Container Catalog.  

.First, try a pull and it should fail because of the default policy.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *podman pull %RHEL_CONTAINER%*

Trying to pull %RHEL_CONTAINER%...
  Running image docker://%RHEL_CONTAINER%:latest is rejected by policy.
Error: error pulling image "%RHEL_CONTAINER%": unable to pull %RHEL_CONTAINER%: unable to pull image: Source image rejected: Running image docker://%RHEL_CONTAINER%:latest is rejected by policy.
```

Configure the sigstore for the RedHat registry.

.Become root to do this.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *sudo -i*
```

.Create the configuration for node1.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
# *cat <<EOF > /etc/containers/registries.d/registry.access.redhat.com.yaml
docker:
     registry.access.redhat.com:
         sigstore: https://access.redhat.com/webassets/docker/content/sigstore
EOF*
```

.Exit from the root shell.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
# *exit*
```

.Configure the trust policy for the RedHat registry.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *sudo podman image trust set -f /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release registry.access.redhat.com*
```

.Examine the trust policy again.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *podman image trust show*
                             insecureAcceptAnything
default                      reject
node1.{GUID}.internal:5000   signedBy                 ec2-user                                   file:///var/tmp/sigstore
registry.access.redhat.com   signedBy                 security@redhat.com, security@redhat.com   https://access.redhat.com/webassets/docker/content/sigstore
```

.Try the image pull again.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *podman pull %RHEL_CONTAINER%*

==== Blocking a registry

It is recommended that a registry trust policy be used to control which registries you want to allow users to pull and push from. This gives greater flexibility, and supports all container runtimes and tools including the docker daemon, podman, buildah and cri-o.

.There are a few ways to approach this.
* Create a default reject policy and trust only node1
* Create a default accept policy and reject node2

Take what you've learn and give each a try.

.Now try to pull the image from node2.{GUID}.internal, it should fail.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *podman pull node2.{GUID}.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi*

Trying to pull node2.{GUID}.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi...
  Running image docker://node2.{GUID}.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi:latest is rejected by policy.
Error: error pulling image "node2.{GUID}.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi": unable to pull node2.{GUID}.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi: unabl
e to pull image: Source image rejected: Running image docker://node2.{GUID}.internal:5000/ubi8/ubi:latest is rejected by p
olicy.
