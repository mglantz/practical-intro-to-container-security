This lab session is a low-level, hands-on introduction to container security using the container tools included with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. It is intended to be consumed as a series of self paced exercises.

.Prerequisites
* An introductory knowledge of Linux and containers is helpful.
* Basic text editing skills using `vim` or `nano`.

==== Important 

TIP: These servers can not be rebuilt in a timely fashion.

.TIPS
* Do not `rm` any files or directories you did not create.
* Make a backup copy before modifying any file.

==== The BookBag Environment 

BookBag provides a integrated student client environment in a web browser. It includes the lab guide, terminals and a collection of client programs (i.e. `ssh`) to access the servers used in the lab. In case you are interested, BookBag runs as a container and can be hosted by `podman` or https://www.openshift.com[OpenShift].

.BookBag Tips
- Increase the width of the web browser to view the table of contents.
- Move the horizontal and vertical dividers as needed.
- Use the menu in the upper right to open additional terminals.
- Commands may be copy and pasted from the lab guide to the terminals.

==== Getting access to the servers

.Bastion
  * `{STUDENT_SSH_COMMAND}`
  * Password: `{STUDENT_SSH_PASSWORD}`

.Nodes
  * To login to the either node from the bastion, `ssh` must be run using `sudo`.

[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
$ *sudo ssh node1.{GUID}.internal*
```
```
[ec2-user@node1 ~]$ 
```

==== Optional BookBag Configuration 

This configuration is optional but helpful. Be certain this is
performed in the BookBag shell only.

.Create a an ssh key pair using the default key file with no pass phrase.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
```
*ssh-keygen -P "" -f $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa*
```
.Create an ssh configuration to prevent the ssh session from timing out.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
```
*echo -e "Host * \nServerAliveInterval 120" >> $HOME/.ssh/config*
```

.Copy the ssh identity to the bastion.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
```
*ssh-copy-id -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" lab-user@{STUDENT_BASTION_HOSTNAME}*
```

.Use this ssh password that was provided in your email.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
```
*{STUDENT_SSH_PASSWORD}*
```

.Example output.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
lab-user@{STUDENT_BASTION_HOSTNAME}'s password: *`{STUDENT_SSH_PASSWORD}`*

Number of key(s) added:        1
```

.Now try logging into the bastion without providing a password.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
*{STUDENT_SSH_COMMAND}*
```

.Example output.
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
```
